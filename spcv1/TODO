//Some Ideas
For making the key accessible to all the clients of the user, we can fix an encryption system for the decryption the key using password of the user as a key for this and then store the encrypted key in the User Model. So when the same user logs in on a different machnine we can decrypt the key for decryption and check whether it matches with the previous key or not.
